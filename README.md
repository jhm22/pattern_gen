# pattern_gen
Islamic Tile Inspired Pattern Generator

This project uses an HTML Canvas element and Javascript to generate geometric patterns. The goal of the project is to produce asthetically pleasing patterns and animations, which can be incorperated into web pages as backgrounds or content. 

The generator is inspired by techniques for teselation, Moire patterns, and Islamic tiling patterns. On a high level, it creates multiple copies of a shape at some spacing, and interesting patterns emerge from the instesection of these repeated shapes.  

There are many as of yet undeveloped functions and features which could be experimented with, such as expanding the supported shapes, rotating and otherwise transforming shapes, and creating new color and outline schemes. 

The index file contains the Canvas element that is drawn to, as well as a sidebar with pattern generation paramaters and some controls. The pattern_gen.js file contains the js object which generates the patterns in the canvas. The js object consists of a number of properties, and some functions. How these properties and functions are set and called can be seen in the index file.
